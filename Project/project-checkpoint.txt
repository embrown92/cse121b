What success have you noted and are most proud of during 
the design and development of your project?
*Working with the HTML and CSS part of the project was very straighforward. 
*Planning and putting together the different elements that needs to be in the 
program was also relatively easy. 


What challenges have you run into during the development?
*Everything was working out find at the beginning when all my code was placed
all in one file. However, I really did ran a few hurdles trying to get to it work 
once it was broken up into the main.js and modules. The file kept crashing and I had to
do quite a few modification. Overall, it was a great learning process for me as it
helped me understand a little bit more how to work with ES modules and which parts of the code to export and import.
